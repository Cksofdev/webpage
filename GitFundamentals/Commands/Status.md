# Git Status

The command 'git status' is extremley helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

using 'git status' will show you what changes are being tracked, arent being tracked, what commits need to be push/pulled, etc. It is ecactly what it sounds like, a status check.

Status is a command that is safe at any time.

If you want to see what is going on its good to use'git status' in between commands until you get to know the flow better.

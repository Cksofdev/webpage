# Git Clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit histpry.

It wil also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use th 'git pull' command to pull updates from the original repository.

It can be done with the 'git clone' command as seen here:
